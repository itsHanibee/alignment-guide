# How do we actually align AI?

<Promise>
How do we, humans, actually go about aligning an intelligence far superior to our own?

**Promise: After reading this, you will know actionable next steps we can take to align superintelligence.**

</Promise>

>“We do have one advantage: we get to build the stuff. **In principle**, we could build a kind of superintelligence that would protect human values. We would certainly have strong reason to do so. **In practice**, the control problem—the problem of how to control what the superintelligence would do—looks quite difficult. **It also looks like we will only get one chance.** Once unfriendly superintelligence exists, it would prevent us from replacing it or changing its preferences. Our fate would be sealed.” - Nick Bostrom
