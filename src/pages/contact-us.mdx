# Contact Us

We wanted a <b>curated central hub of information and resources</b> for alignment:

<ol className="list-decimal ml-8 space-y-1.5 mt-1.5"> 
    <li>It seems to us that there is a lot of confusion (and negative attention) around AI alignment.</li>
    <li>We often find ourselves repeating many of the same points in discussions about alignment.</li>
    <li>Most importantly, we want to be able to share a digestible resource to others who either want to learn more or get involved.</li>
</ol>

With this in mind, we co-created this website. We're always open to feedback and contributions.
