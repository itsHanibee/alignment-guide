# Why Alignment Urgently Matters

<Promise>
  There’s a lot of misunderstanding about what AI alignment is, why it urgently
  matters, and what we actually mean when we say “AI can end the world.”
  <b>
    In the following 5 steps and their corresponding pages, we help you
    understand.

1. <LinkBadge

     text="What exactly is AI “alignment”?"
   /> We explain that AI alignment is about designing powerful AI systems to ensure
   they **try to do what we want them to do**.

2. Aligning AI seems simple, so why is it worth discussing?

   **The Difficulty Behind Alignment:** [Why is alignment difficult?](https://www.notion.so/Why-is-alignment-difficult-385f815223004c148a1e6879afe10bcf?pvs=21)

3. Is unaligned AI that bad? How would a chatbot, even if it was smart, take over the world?

   **The Risks of Unaligned AI:** [Superintelligence: default dangerous](https://www.notion.so/Superintelligence-default-dangerous-9ef0d11a444845eda56b09077b781547?pvs=21)

4. Okay, but we’ll figure it out when the time comes. 1) We have lots of time: superintelligent AI is far away. 2) We’ve always figured out technical challenges in the past.

   **The Urgency of Alignment:** [Why this is urgent](https://www.notion.so/Why-this-is-urgent-af137b54fa664cf0b214a0385c1c3fd1?pvs=21)

5. No creature less intelligent than us has been able to align humans. But we do have one advantage: we get to build this stuff.

   **Our Unique Opportunity**: [How do we actually align AI?](https://www.notion.so/How-do-we-actually-align-AI-2eddeb9538e848c8b45b2b4701ee5afc?pvs=21)
