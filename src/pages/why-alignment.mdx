# Why Alignment Urgently Matters

<Promise>
  There’s a lot of misunderstanding about what AI alignment is, why it urgently
  matters, and what we actually mean when we say “AI can end the world.”
  
  **In the following 5 steps and their corresponding pages, we help you
  understand.**
</Promise>

1. <LinkBadge href="why-alignment/understanding-alignment">What exactly is AI “alignment”?</LinkBadge>
    We explain that AI alignment is about designing powerful AI systems to ensure
   they **try to do what we want them to do**.

2. Aligning AI seems simple, so why is it worth discussing? <LinkBadge href="why-alignment/why-alignment-is-difficult">Why is alignment difficult?</LinkBadge>

3. Is unaligned AI that bad? How would a chatbot, even if it was smart, take over the world? In <LinkBadge href="why-alignment/default-dangerous">Unaligned AI: default dangerous</LinkBadge>, we explain why AI's default trajectory is lethal for humans.

4. Okay, but we’ll figure it out when the time comes. 1) We have lots of time: superintelligent AI is far away. 2) We’ve always figured out technical challenges in the past. <LinkBadge href="why-alignment/why-this-is-urgent">Why is this urgent?</LinkBadge>

5. No creature less intelligent than us has been able to align humans. But we do have one advantage: <b>we get to build this stuff.</b> So: <LinkBadge href="why-alignment/our-opportunity">How we actually align AI?</LinkBadge>
