# Why Alignment Urgently Matters

<Promise>
  There’s a lot of misunderstanding about what AI alignment is, why it urgently
  matters, and what we actually mean when we say “AI can end the world.”
  <b>
    In the following 5 steps and their corresponding pages, we help you
    understand.
  </b>
</Promise>

1. <LinkBadge
     link="why-alignment/understanding-alignment"
     text="What exactly is AI “alignment”?"
   /> We explain that AI alignment is about designing powerful AI systems to ensure
   they **try to do what we want them to do**.

2. Aligning AI seems simple, so why is it worth discussing? <LinkBadge link="why-alignment/why-alignment-is-difficult" text="Why is alignment difficult?" />

3. Is unaligned AI that bad? How would a chatbot, even if it was smart, take over the world? In <LinkBadge link="why-alignment/default-dangerous" text="Unaligned AI: default dangerous" />, we explain why AI's default trajectory is lethal for humans.

4. Okay, but we’ll figure it out when the time comes. 1) We have lots of time: superintelligent AI is far away. 2) We’ve always figured out technical challenges in the past. <LinkBadge link="why-alignment/why-this-is-urgent" text="Why is this urgent?" />

5. No creature less intelligent than us has been able to align humans. But we do have one advantage: <b>we get to build this stuff.</b> So: <LinkBadge link="why-alignment/our-opportunity" text="How we actually align AI?" />
