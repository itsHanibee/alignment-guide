# Quickstart: How to use this guide

## What exactly is this guide?

Most resources and knowledge about alignment are currently scattered (and it’s hard to know what’s important).

**This guide is a curated central hub of information and resources for alignment.** We keep every page short for you, with options to dig deeper.
