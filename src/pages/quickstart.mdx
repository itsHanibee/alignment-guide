## Using this guide

We recommend you start with a look at <LinkBadge href='/why-alignment'>Why Alignment is Urgent</LinkBadge> for an overview for what the alignment problem is about and why it matters; even if you've heard of alignment before, there's a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings within the space.

<LinkBadge href='/overview-current-efforts'>Overview of Current Efforts</LinkBadge> actually dives into what current organizations are doing, and then we further expand on those technical research directions in <LinkBadge href='/research-directions'>Research Directions</LinkBadge>.

Lastly, <LinkBadge href='/next-steps'>Next Steps</LinkBadge> is where we recommend you go if you want to start working on alignment.
