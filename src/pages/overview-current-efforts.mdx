# Overview of current efforts

<Promise>
  There are many great organizations conducting significant alignment research.
  Here are a few of them and a brief overview of their work.
  <b>
    After reading this, you will have an overview of a few research directions
    at these companies and know where to go to read more.

        <b>OpenAI</b> is working on Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) and
        have also conducted prior work on understanding Reward Model
        Overoptimization.

            <b>W2SG</b> is the idea of using a smaller, less intelligent model
            to align a larger, more powerful model while still extracting the
            latent knowledge of the more powerful model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reward Model Overoptimization</b> examines how models may focus
            on optimizing a proxy measure instead of achieving the actual
            objective (i.e. Goodhart’s law). OpenAI has conducted research on
            the scaling laws associated with this phenomenon.

        <b>Anthropic</b> is working on understanding Sleeper Agents, Sparse
        Autoencoders (SAEs), and Circuit Analysis.

            <b>Sleeper Agents:</b> Humans can act deceptively, appearing helpful
            while secretly pursuing hidden objectives. Anthropic has explored
            whether current safety techniques can eliminate learned deceptive
            strategies in AI systems. In particular, they have found that
            removing deceptive behavior with current techniques is not always
            possible.

          <li>
            <b>Sparse Autoencoders and Monosemanticity:</b> Many neurons in
            neural networks are polysemantic, responding to mixtures of
            seemingly unrelated inputs. This complexity makes interpretability
            challenging, as it becomes difficult to understand the function of
            each component within the network. Sparse Autoencoders generate
            learned features from a trained model, offering more monosemantic
            units of analysis than the model's neurons themselves.

        Frontier Safety Framework.

        <ul>

            <b>Activation Steering</b> is a technique whereby one takes
            activation vectors from the residual stream of a model on specific
            prompts and adds these vectors to the residual stream on a different
            prompt. This manipulation causes the output of the second prompt to
            inherit properties from the first, enabling one to steer the model’s
            outputs toward desired behaviors or themes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Frontier Safety Framework:</b> Deepmind released a specification
            of protocols for detecting “Critical Capability Levels” of models
            and how to mitigate the risks posed when models surpass these
            capabilities.
