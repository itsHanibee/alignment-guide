        <p>
            When you think of misaligned AI, you might think of the Terminator movies, but superintelligence doesn't need to be 'evil' to pose a threat. By default, all intelligent agents—including
            humans—aim to preserve themselves, acquire resources, and improve themselves. This means AI smarter than us could inadvertently endanger humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be clear, there is <span className='font-bold'>no guarantee</span> that AI will care about the same exact values we do.
        </p>
        <p>Think of when the atomic bomb was first being created: before we ever needed to worry about misuse, there was the very real possibility that we could accidentally set the world on fire.</p>
        <p>We’re on the path to build something much harder to contain than nuclear weapons—superintelligent AI. Alignment is making sure we don’t accidentally end the world.</p>

            <p>We do NOT advocate for slowing or pausing AI capabilities research.</p>
            <p>
                The best alignment methods have stemmed from advancements in AI capabilities—a trend we expect to continue. Moreover, pausing AI at this stage is completely unrealistic and undesirable due
                to overwhelming economic and technological incentives.

            <p>We are NOT suggesting that a misaligned AGI must possess consciousness or even seem as intelligent as a cat or dog.</p>
            <p>
                It doesn't need to harbor any animosity towards humans to pose a threat. Just as autonomous drones can be dangerous without consciousness, a misaligned AGI, with its significantly greater
                potential, could be far more hazardous.

                <p>AGI Alignment, like the development of AGI itself, is a challenging technical problem.</p>
                <p>While fields such as philosophy and politics are vital for validating and ensuring the adoption of solutions, alignment remains a technical issue requiring a technical approach.</p>

                <p>Alignment is a solvable problem, but also an urgent one. </p>
                <p>
                    Leading AI companies predict AGI by 2029, and we need to solve alignment beforehand since we won't get another chance afterward. We have one critical try to get it right—unlike a mere
                    segmentation fault, misaligned AGI could have catastrophic consequences.
